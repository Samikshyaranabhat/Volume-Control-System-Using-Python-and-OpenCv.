This project involves developing a no-contact, webcam-based gesture volume control. It detects hand landmarks through MediaPipe and tracks the distance between the index finger and the thumb to automatically increase or decrease the system volume. The primary objective is to demonstrate real time computer vision techniques and gesture recognition that are able to control hardware functions without physical contact.
